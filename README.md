## About this project
I take two types of noise functions, the pearlin and a simple one. The program create a two dimensional matrix taking thre diferent pearling noise functions interpolated, one for the mountains, other for the hills and another for the plains. Finally the program aply color in it and generate the biomes wiht a simple noise function, and that's all for now. Actually I made it just for fun and I have only used it for a terrain generator in Godot.

Enjoys the code.
